   - Include all necessary details while avoiding tangential information
   - Structure the answer logically with clear explanations
   - Use examples where appropriate to illustrate concepts

3. Ensure the content is accurate and relevant
   - Verify information against reliable sources
   - Focus on core concepts from the learning material
   - Update content to reflect current understanding in the field

4. Break down complex topics into digestible pieces
   - Split multi-part concepts into separate flashcards
   - Create prerequisite cards for foundational knowledge
   - Build knowledge progressively from basic to advanced

5. Use clear, unambiguous language
   - Avoid jargon unless it's essential to the subject
   - Define technical terms when first introduced
   - Use precise wording to prevent misinterpretation

6. Include key terms and concepts in both questions and answers
   - Highlight important vocabulary
   - Reinforce terminology through repetition
   - Connect related concepts to build a knowledge network

7. Write questions that promote critical thinking
   - Include application and analysis-level questions
   - Ask for comparisons and contrasts
   - Encourage problem-solving and reasoning

8. Keep answers concise but comprehensive
   - Include only essential information
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity
   - Maintain a consistent level of detail across cards

9. Use consistent formatting and structure
   - Maintain uniform question patterns
   - Use consistent punctuation and capitalization
   - Apply standard formatting for similar types of content

10. Avoid overly complex or compound questions
    - Focus on testing one concept per card
    - Break multi-part questions into separate cards
    - Ensure questions can be answered definitively
